# ADA TaLKS

Our work on **Conversational Agents** can be described as *Adaptive Dialogue Agents using Task-oriented Learning with Knowledge and Senses*.

ADA TaLKS represents the [CLiPS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/) research part of the [Flanders AI Research Program](https://www.flandersai.be/en) focusing on conversational agents as part of the human-like AI challenge. Within our work package on conversational agents, we cooperate with the Universities of Leuven ([LIIR](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be)), Brussels ([AI-LAB](https://ai.vub.ac.be)) and Ghent ([LT3](https://lt3.ugent.be) and [K2T](https://ugentt2k.github.io)). On [this page](/ADATaLKS/researchvideos/) you can find short video's on all the current research in our workpackage.

The focus of ADA TaLKS is on enabling a flexible method for incorporating and updating relevant background knowledge in a deep learning approach for dialog systems. In addition, we are researching memory encoding in order to improve consistency of the generated answers with the dialog history and the agent's persona.

## Proofs of Technology
#### VaccinChat
We developed a Dutch chatbot that answers FAQ's on COVID-19 vaccines and the Flemish vaccination strategy: https://vaccinchat.be/

This project also gave us insight in the evolution of user questions over time: https://app.flourish.studio/visualisation/6517886



#### Car insurance chatbot for Belfius
In this work different data augmentation methods were tested to lift the performance of Belfiusâ€™ less-used French car insurance bot to the level of the more frequently used Dutch system. These methods include back-translation, paraphrasing and question generation.
